# D5-Collab-software

For Alex and Neil this is the github for team B project. we provide this link so you can see the software as clearly as possible as well as commit history. 

For everyone, the main project is called example, and must be complied in the example folder when download. However example.c is provide on the top level for easy access. this is still the final code but does not contain the full commit history.
